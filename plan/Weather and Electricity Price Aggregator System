Software Developer Candidate Test Task
Weather and Electricity Price Aggregator System

Introduction
Imagine a scenario where a local energy research group is conducting a study on electricity pricing trends and their correlation with weather conditions. To assist them, you will develop a backend application that aggregates electricity prices and weather data, allowing users to query and analyze historical trends.
This system should allow users to upload historical electricity price data, in the background fetch weather information, and provide an API to retrieve aggregated insights.

Project Requirements
CSV File Upload for Electricity Prices
Implement an endpoint to upload the provided CSV file containing historical electricity prices.
Provided data file is for 2024
Read and save the date and NPS (Nordpool Spot Price) for Estonia(Eesti) (“NPS Eesti”) to database
Data should be stored in a PostgreSQL database.
Support upserting (update if the record exists, insert if it does not).


Fetch Weather Data from Open Meteo API
Implement functionality that periodically fetches hourly temperature data from Open Meteo Historical Weather API (e.g., once per minute to ensure no gaps in data).
API Docs: https://open-meteo.com/en/docs/historical-weather-api
Open Meteo does not require registration and an API key to use
The weather data should only be fetched for periods where we have any price data available
Data should be stored with the following fields:
Date (YYYY-MM-DD)
Average Temperature (°C)


Data Querying API
Implement a RESTful API that allows querying data by date range.
Granularity should be day
Query Parameters:
startDate (YYYY-MM-DD)
endDate (YYYY-MM-DD)
Example output:


Technical Requirements
Backend: Spring Boot (Java)
Database: PostgreSQL
Containerization: Docker setup for both the backend and the database

Bonus Features (Optional)
Testing:
Use Testcontainers to run integration tests with PostgreSQL in a containerized environment.
API Documentation: Swagger (OpenAPI)
